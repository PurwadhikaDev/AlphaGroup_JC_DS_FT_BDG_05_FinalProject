## 1. Business Problem

Olist generates revenue from two primary sources:  
- **Seller subscriptions**  
- **Commissions from sold items**  

To maximize commissions, we need to identify the best-performing products. Since Olist's products come from sellers, finding the top sellers is key to increasing commission-based revenue.

### **Our Approach**
We will focus on three main areas:
1. **Analyzing Olist‚Äôs Business Performance**  
2. **Understanding Buyer Preferences in Shopping on Olist**  
3. **Analyzing and modeling which sellers to retain and prioritize for churn prevention**  

## 2. Analysis

### **2.1. Objective: Maximizing Profit & Preventing Losses**  

Our primary goal is to **maximize profit** by identifying the best in each category:  
- üõçÔ∏è **Best Products** ‚Äì High-demand and high-profit items  
- üë§ **Best Buyers** ‚Äì Loyal customers with high spending  
- üè™ **Best Sellers** ‚Äì Reliable sellers with strong performance  

Additionally, we aim to **prevent profit loss** by detecting and addressing seller churn. Future growth opportunities include identifying **promising cities for expansion** and **high-potential product categories** for investment.  

### **2.2. How Does Olist Generate Revenue?**

- **Commission on Sales:** 18% platform fee and 5% operating cost per item sold.
- **Subscription Fees:** $39 BRL monthly subscription.

### **2.3. Stakeholders**

#### 1. Olist (Company Perspective)  
- **Problem:** Identifying high-performing sellers who are at risk of churning.  
- **Impact:** Loss of revenue **commissions** if top sellers leave or stop selling.  

#### 2. Seller Perspective  
- **Problem:** High-performing sellers may churn if they don't get sales for a long time.  
- **Impact:** Losing **top sellers**, reducing product availability and sales volume.  

#### 3. Buyer Perspective  
- **Problem:** A decline in product variety on Olist Store makes the platform less attractive.  
- **Impact:** **Lower sales revenue** due to reduced customer engagement and purchases.

### **2.4. Analytical Approach**
We will separate our analysis into two major categories:
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Focuses on understanding business, seller, and buyer performance.
- **Inferential Analytics**: Focuses on modeling to predict churn for the next quarter based on seller performance from the last three months.
