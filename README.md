## 1. Business Problem

Olist generates revenue from two primary sources:  
- **Seller subscriptions**  
- **Commissions from sold items**  

To maximize commissions, we need to identify the best-performing products. Since Olist's products come from sellers, finding the top sellers is key to increasing commission-based revenue.

### **Our Approach**
We will focus on three main areas:
1. **Analyzing Olist‚Äôs Business Performance**  
2. **Understanding Buyer Preferences in Shopping on Olist**  
3. **Analyzing and modeling which sellers to retain and prioritize for churn prevention**  

## 2. Analysis

### **2.1. Objective: Maximizing Profit & Preventing Losses**  

Our primary goal is to **maximize profit** by identifying the best in each category:  
- üõçÔ∏è **Best Products** ‚Äì High-demand and high-profit items  
- üë§ **Best Buyers** ‚Äì Loyal customers with high spending  
- üè™ **Best Sellers** ‚Äì Reliable sellers with strong performance  

Additionally, we aim to **prevent profit loss** by detecting and addressing seller churn. Future growth opportunities include identifying **promising cities for expansion** and **high-potential product categories** for investment.  

### **2.2. How Does Olist Generate Revenue?**

- **Commission on Sales:** 18% platform fee and 5% operating cost per item sold.
- **Subscription Fees:** $39 BRL monthly subscription.

### **2.3. Stakeholders**

#### 1. Olist (Company Perspective)  
- **Problem:** Identifying high-performing sellers who are at risk of churning.  
- **Impact:** Loss of revenue **commissions** if top sellers leave or stop selling.  

#### 2. Seller Perspective  
- **Problem:** High-performing sellers may churn if they don't get sales for a long time.  
- **Impact:** Losing **top sellers**, reducing product availability and sales volume.  

#### 3. Buyer Perspective  
- **Problem:** A decline in product variety on Olist Store makes the platform less attractive.  
- **Impact:** **Lower sales revenue** due to reduced customer engagement and purchases.

### **2.4. Analytical Approach**
We will separate our analysis into two major categories:
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Focuses on understanding business, seller, and buyer performance.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Focuses on modeling to predict churn for the next quarter based on seller performance from the last three months.

## 3. Data Overview

We have combined 8 CSV datasets into 3 focused datasets:

| **Original Dataset** | **New Dataset** |
| --- | --- |
| olist_customers_dataset.csv | business_side.csv |

| olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv |  |
| olist_orders_dataset.csv |  |
| olist_products_dataset.csv |  |
| olist_sellers_dataset.csv |  |
| product_category_name_translation |  |

- The dataset represents **sales data from Olist**.  
- Each row in the dataset corresponds to **a transaction of a product** in Olist‚Äôs partner marketplace.

## 9. Modeling (TBD) and result
Here for what feature we will use


## 10. Deployment

We deployed this model using Streamlit to assist Account Managers (B2B Seller Relations) in identifying and prioritizing sellers at risk of churn.
By uploading quarterly data, the model predicts whether a seller is likely to churn or not. <br> The results can be downloaded based on priority levels, highlighting **Top Priority Sellers** (high-value sellers at risk of churn) and **Standard Priority Sellers** (moderate-value sellers at risk of churn).
